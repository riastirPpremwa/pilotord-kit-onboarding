## Step 2: Creating a New Song
 
To create a new song, click on the New button on the Main Toolbar or select File > New from the menu. A dialog box will appear asking you to choose a style for your song. A style is a set of musical rules and patterns that define how your song will sound. You can choose from over 390 band styles and 200 drum styles that cover various genres and moods.
 
You can browse through the styles by clicking on the arrows or typing in the search box. You can preview a style by clicking on the Play button or double-clicking on its name. You can also sort the styles by name, genre, tempo, feel, or rating by clicking on the column headers. Once you have found a style that you like, click on OK to select it.
 
A new song will be created with eight tracks: one drum track and seven instrument tracks. Each track will have a default instrument assigned to it based on the style you chose. You can change the instrument of any track by clicking on its name and selecting a different instrument from the list. You can also add or delete tracks by using the buttons on the Track Toolbar.
 
Your song will also have one measure with a default chord assigned to it based on the style you chose. A measure is a unit of time in music that contains a fixed number of beats. A chord is a combination of notes that sound good together. You can change the chord of any measure by clicking on it and selecting a different chord from the list or typing it in using chord symbols (e.g., Cmaj7). You can also add or delete measures by using the buttons on the Measure Toolbar.
 
## Step 3: Editing a Style
 
A style consists of two components: a groove and a musician style. A groove is a rhythmic pattern that defines how each track will play in each measure. A musician style is a melodic pattern that defines what notes each track will play in each measure. You can edit both components by using the Style View and the Style Editor.
 
To access the Style View, click on the Style tab at the bottom of the main window or select View > Style from the menu. The Style View
