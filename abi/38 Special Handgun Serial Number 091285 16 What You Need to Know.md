If you own a 38 special handgun, you might be curious about its history and origin. When was it manufactured? Who was the original owner? What model is it? These are some of the questions that can be answered by looking up the serial number of your firearm.
 
The serial number is a unique identifier that can reveal a lot of information about your gun, such as the year of production, the manufacturer, the model, and sometimes even the caliber and features. However, finding the serial number and decoding it can be tricky, as different gun makers have different systems and formats for their serial numbers.

## Where to Find the Serial Number on Your 38 Special Handgun
 
The first step to finding out when your 38 special handgun was made is to locate the serial number on your firearm. The serial number is usually stamped or engraved on a metal part of the gun, such as the frame, the barrel, the cylinder, or the slide. However, the exact location and appearance of the serial number may vary depending on the manufacturer and model of your gun.
 
For example, if you have a Colt 38 special revolver, you can find the serial number on the bottom of the butt (the part of the grip that rests on your palm), on the back of the cylinder (the part that holds the bullets), or on the frame behind the crane (the part that swings out to load or unload the cylinder). If you have a Smith & Wesson 38 special revolver, you can find the serial number on the bottom of the grip frame, on the inside of the yoke (the part that connects the cylinder to the frame), or on the side of the barrel.

## How to Decode Your Serial Number
 
Once you have found your serial number, you can use it to find out when your 38 special handgun was made. However, this may require some research and detective work, as different manufacturers have different ways of encoding their serial numbers. Some use letters and numbers, some use only numbers, some use dashes or spaces, some use prefixes or suffixes, and some change their system over time.
 
For example, let's look at our sample serial number: 091285 16. This is a six-digit number followed by a space and another two-digit number. This format suggests that this is a Smith & Wesson 38 special revolver made between 1957 and 1983. How do we know this? Because Smith & Wesson used this format for their K-frame revolvers (a popular line of medium-sized revolvers) during this period.
 
The first four digits (0912) indicate the production year of this revolver. Smith & Wesson assigned each year a four-digit code starting with 0000 in 1957 and ending with 9999 in 1983. To find out what year corresponds to what code, you can use this table from The Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson by Jim Supica and Richard Nahas:

| Year | Code |
| --- | --- |

| 1957 | 0000-1500 |

| 1958 | 1501-30400 |

| 1959 | 30401-55000 |

| 1960 | 55001-75000 |

| 1961 | 75001-95200 |

| 1962 | 95201-123400 |
