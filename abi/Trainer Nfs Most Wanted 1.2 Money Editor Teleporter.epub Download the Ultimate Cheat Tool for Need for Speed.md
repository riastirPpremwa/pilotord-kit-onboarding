## Tips and Tricks for Need for Speed: Most Wanted
 
Need for Speed: Most Wanted is not only about racing and escaping from the cops. It is also about exploring the open world of Rockport and finding hidden secrets and shortcuts. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your skills and enjoy the game more.

- Memorize shortcuts. Shortcuts are essential for winning races and evading pursuits. They can save you time, distance, and trouble by allowing you to cut corners, avoid traffic, or lose your pursuers. You can find shortcuts by looking for gaps in fences, walls, or buildings, or by following signs that indicate alternative routes. Some shortcuts are obvious, while others are hidden or require some skill to access. Experiment with different paths and see what works best for you.
- Use speedbreaker. Speedbreaker is a feature that allows you to slow down time and gain more control over your car. You can activate it by pressing the left trigger on your controller. Speedbreaker can be useful for avoiding collisions, taking sharp turns, or maneuvering through tight spaces. You can also use it to ram into cops or opponents and send them flying. Speedbreaker has a limited duration and recharges over time, so use it wisely.
- Upgrade your car. Upgrading your car is important for keeping up with the competition and the cops. You can upgrade your car's performance, visuals, and parts by visiting shops around the city. Performance upgrades improve your car's speed, acceleration, handling, and nitrous. Visual upgrades change your car's appearance and style. Parts upgrades allow you to install special items that enhance your car's abilities, such as junkman parts, which increase your performance beyond the normal limits.
- Explore the city. Rockport is a large and diverse city that offers many opportunities for exploration and discovery. You can find hidden shops, bonus markers, photo tickets, milestones, rap sheets, and more by roaming around the city. You can also find unique jumps, which are ramps that allow you to perform spectacular stunts and earn rewards. Exploring the city can also help you learn the layout of the streets and find useful shortcuts.
- Try out different modes. Need for Speed: Most Wanted offers several modes to challenge yourself and have fun. Besides the career mode, which is the main story mode, you can also try out the challenge series mode, which consists of 68 events that test your skills in various scenarios. You can also try out the quick race mode, which allows you to customize your own races with different cars, tracks, and options. You can also play online with other players in multiplayer mode.

Need for Speed: Most Wanted is a game that offers a lot of variety and excitement for racing fans. By following these tips and tricks, you can improve your gameplay and have more fun with this classic game.
