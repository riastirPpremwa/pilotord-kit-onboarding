KBO League is not only a fun and exciting game to play, but also to watch. The league is known for its vocal and exuberant fan base, who cheer, chant, and sing throughout the game. The league is also famous for its widespread practice of bat flips, where hitters toss their bats in the air after hitting what they think will be a home run. Bat flips are considered a way of expressing joy and passion in the KBO League, rather than showing off or disrespecting the opponent.
 
The KBO League has a rich history and tradition that dates back to 1982, when it was founded with six franchises: Haitai Tigers (now Kia Tigers), Samsung Lions, Lotte Giants, MBC Chungyong (now LG Twins), OB Bears (now Doosan Bears), and Sammi Superstars (now SSG Landers). The league expanded to eight teams in 1990, 10 teams in 2015, and 12 teams in 2023. The most successful team in the league is the Kia Tigers, who have won 11 championships, followed by the Samsung Lions with eight titles.
 
The KBO League has also produced many talented players who have gone on to play in Major League Baseball, such as Shin-Soo Choo, Hyun-jin Ryu, Jung-ho Kang, Ji-man Choi, and Ha-seong Kim. The league has also attracted many foreign players who have made an impact in the KBO League, such as Eric Thames, Dustin Nippert, Josh Lindblom, Mel Rojas Jr., and JosÃ© Miguel FernÃ¡ndez.
 
The KBO League is one of the most popular sports leagues in South Korea, attracting millions of fans every year. According to Statista, the league generated about 56 billion South Korean won (about 47 million U.S. dollars) in ticket revenue in 2021. The league also gained international exposure and recognition when ESPN began to televise its games during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
