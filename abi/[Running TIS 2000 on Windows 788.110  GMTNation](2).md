# How to Install Opel TIS 2000 on Windows 7 64 Bit
 
If you have an Opel car and want to use the TIS 2000 software to diagnose or program it, you may encounter some compatibility issues with your Windows 7 64 bit operating system. TIS 2000 is a 32-bit application that was designed to run on Windows XP or earlier versions. However, there are some ways to make it work on Windows 7 64 bit, either by using a virtual machine or by dual booting.
 
## Using a Virtual Machine
 
A virtual machine is a software that simulates a different operating system within your current one. You can use a virtual machine to run Windows XP on your Windows 7 64 bit computer, and then install TIS 2000 on the virtual machine. This way, you can access TIS 2000 without affecting your main operating system.

One of the most popular virtual machines for Windows is [Windows Virtual PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702), which is free and easy to use. However, you will need a genuine copy of Windows XP and a license key to install it on the virtual machine. You will also need a version of Windows 7 that supports Windows Virtual PC, such as Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate.
 
Here are the steps to install TIS 2000 on Windows 7 64 bit using Windows Virtual PC:
 
1. Download and install [Windows Virtual PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702) and [Windows XP Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002) from Microsoft's website.
2. Run Windows XP Mode and follow the instructions to set up the virtual machine.
3. Copy the cracked TIS 2000 zip file from [this link](http://www.obdii365.com/wholesale/tis2000-cd-and-usb-key-for-gm-tech2-gm-car-model.html) to the desktop of the virtual machine.
4. Extract the zip file and follow the README.txt inside to install TIS 2000.
5. Connect your Opel car to your computer using a Tech 2 scanner and a serial port adapter.
6. Run TIS 2000 on the virtual machine and enjoy!

## Dual Booting
 
Dual booting is another option to run TIS 2000 on Windows 7 64 bit. Dual booting means installing two operating systems on separate partitions of your hard drive, and choosing which one to boot when you start your computer. You can dual boot Windows 7 64 bit and Windows XP 32 bit, and then install TIS 2000 on the latter.
 
However, dual booting is more complicated and risky than using a virtual machine. You will need to partition your hard drive, which may cause data loss or corruption if not done properly. You will also need a copy of Windows XP and a license key to install it on the new partition. Moreover, you will have to reboot your computer every time you want to switch between operating systems.
