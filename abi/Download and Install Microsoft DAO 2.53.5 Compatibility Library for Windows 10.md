If you are working with an older version of Access database that uses Data Access Objects (DAO), you may encounter some compile errors when you run or convert your database in Access 2002 or later. This is because the DAO library has been updated and some of the older references may not be compatible with the newer versions of Access.
 
To fix this problem, you need to download and install the Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.5 Compatibility Library, which is a component that provides backward compatibility for DAO code in Access 2002 and later. This library allows you to use the same DAO code that you used in earlier versions of Access without any changes.
