The film has two parallel tracks: one set in the past, where Bodhidharma (Suriya) travels from India to China and teaches them martial arts and medicine; and the other set in the present, where Subha (Shruti Haasan) discovers that she is a genetic descendant of Bodhidharma and tries to awaken his dormant DNA in Aravind (Suriya), a circus artist who looks exactly like him. Meanwhile, Dong Lee (Johnny Nguyen), a Chinese spy and martial arts expert, is sent to India to unleash a deadly virus that can wipe out the entire population. Subha and Aravind have to stop him and save the country.
 
The film boasts of some spectacular action sequences, especially the ones involving Dong Lee and Aravind. The climax fight on a train is a highlight of the film. The cinematography by Ravi K Chandran is top-notch and captures the different locations and eras with finesse. The music by Harris Jayaraj is catchy and suits the mood of the film. The songs "Oh Ringa Ringa" and "Mun Andhi" are particularly popular among the audience. The editing by Anthony could have been tighter, as the film drags in some parts and feels too long at 168 minutes.

The film also has some flaws that mar its impact. The screenplay by Murugadoss is inconsistent and loses focus on the main theme of Bodhidharma's legacy. The film tries to incorporate too many subplots and genres, such as romance, comedy, patriotism, history, science fiction, thriller, etc., and ends up being a mishmash of everything. The film also suffers from logical loopholes and factual errors that are hard to ignore. The dialogues are preachy and melodramatic at times. The performances by the supporting cast are mediocre and hammy.
